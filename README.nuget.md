Adds a MemberListView dashboard to the Members area in Umbraco 8.6+ to allow easier management of members including approval and unlocking capabilities.
The MemberListView for Umbraco 8 and 9 provides a management dashboard view for Members with convenient filtering and sorting and allows for mass Unlock, Suspension or Activation of members.

Installing the package enables a new Manage Dashboard on the Members section.

## Features

The Member List View has been designed to be similar to the ContentListView property editor and features a Create button to allow for quick creation of new Members and context-sensitive action buttons to Unlock, Approve or Suspend members depending on the status of their account as well as the ability to Delete them.  All actions can be performed on batches of users, as they apply to selected users only.

## Member Editing

Member Editing can be done without leaving the MemberListView by clicking on a member name, which creates a Dialog pulled in from the right side to edit the member.
