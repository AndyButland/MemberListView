Adds a MemberListView dashboard to the Members area in Umbraco 7.1 + to allow easier management of members including approval and unlocking capabilities.
The MemberListView for Umbraco 7 provides a management dashboard view for Members with convenient filtering and sorting and allows for mass Unlock, 
Suspension or Activation of members.

Installing the package enables a new Manage Dashboard on the Members section.

**Version 1.2.0**

* **Compiled against Umbraco 7.7**
* Fixed issue with suspending/activating/deleting members

**Version 0.9.12**

* Fixed "Error: Argument 'MemberManager.Dashboard.MemberListViewController' is not a function" issue due to update in ClientDependency module

**Version 0.9.11**

* UI cleanup - paging now consistent with 7.2.0 ListView
* Issue with UnApproved members showing up in the list as approved.

**Version 0.9.10**

* Export - Export now supports additional user indexed fields. If you add a property to a member type and want it to be exported, add it to the IndexUserFields collection in the ExamineIndex.config file.

**Version 0.9.9**

* Search is now lightning fast, although some modification to the Examine Index configuration is required. 
* Filtering - filtering has now been moved to a dialog, includes Membership Flags and MemberType as default fields and is extendable.
* Export - Filtered members can now be exported to a CSV file containing basic fields.
